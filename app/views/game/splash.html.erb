        <h4>How well do YOU know your Facebook Friends?</h4>
        <p>
        People are getting smarter about
        their <strong>privacy online</strong>.
        By now, we all know to restrict our profiles so that <strong>only friends</strong> can see
        our personal information.  But after 3, 4, 5+ <strong>years</strong> of social networking, do
        you still even <strong><em>know</em></strong> all your friends?

        <p>Unfortunately, due to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/changelog#v2_0_login">changes in the Facebook API</a>. We are no longer able to fetch a list of your friends, even with your explicit permission, meaning the game is over!</p>
        <p>We hope you had a chance to play while the site was operational and encourage you to check out archived results at the link below. Thanks!</p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
    When you hit 'Go' below, you will have <strong>90 seconds</strong> to name
    as many of your Facebook friends as you can.  Friends will
    be selected randomly, and presented to you with their profile
    pictures.
    </p>

    <p>
    You must type their first or last name (or both!), and once you
    have answered correctly the game will automatically move on.
    Don't worry about spelling too much, just get it mostly right.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you don't know someone, hit "I don't know" to quickly move on without wasting too much time!
    <strong>Hint</strong>: Hover over the images for a larger photo.
    </p>

    <p>
    Good luck!
